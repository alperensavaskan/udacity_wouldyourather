# Would Your Rather..? Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. In this application, I showed my knowledge using the basics of react and the react redux library.

I used the _DATA.js file given as a template in the backend of the application.

It's a poll portal. The application opens with the login page with user selection. Afterwards, a Home page opens with users' questions. On this home page, the questions answered and not answered by the logged in user are listed. The user can vote here or look at the results for the questions he voted for.

The user can add his own question from the New Question page. In addition, there is a leaderboard page where top users are shown according to the answers given and the number of questions added.

## Instructions

To install & launch the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
